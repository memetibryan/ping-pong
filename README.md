# PING PONG.

This project is about a fun-based website that helps the user mathematically,that is, helps one find the multiples of 3, 5 and 15 that helps one relax his mind. Its a game-website called 'ping pong' where the user enters a number
to find out whether the number is a multiple of 3, 5 or 15. If the number input is a multiple of 3, the name 'ping' is displayed.
If the number is a multiple of 5 then 'pong' is displayed. If the number is not a multiple of any of the above mentioned.Then 'ping pong'
is displayed. So basically it's a mathematical-oriented website but in a fun-based manner.
